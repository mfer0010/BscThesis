\noindent The CD that was handed in with this document contains the following files:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Data:} This folder contains all the data used for this study, as well as \textit{.pkl} files created during the course of this work.
	\item \textbf{Code:} All the code can be found here and is ordered accordingly.
	\item \textbf{`main.pdf':} This is a soft copy of this document.
	\item \textbf{`thesis.yaml':} The Anaconda environment needed to properly run the code.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{ }This code was run and created on a Linux System (Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS) using Python 3 and the Anaconda Environment provided with the code (`thesis.yaml'). In order to run the code make sure you have Python 3 installed and Anaconda, then make sure you're in the correct directory and run the following in the terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ conda env create --file thesis.yaml
$ source activate thesis
$ jupyter notebook
\end{lstlisting}
