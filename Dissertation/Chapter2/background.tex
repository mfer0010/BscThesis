%%The Particular area of interest to this study:
\paragraph{ }The \acs{LHC} is filled to the required maximum intensity by injecting electron bunch trains from the \acs{SPS} through a transfer line using kicker magnets [CITE HERE]. This is a challenging task given the high energy of the beam, the very small apertures and the delivery precision's tight tolerances, thus multiple sensors are installed around the \acs{CERN} particle accelerator complex [CITE HERE] which gather readings and data that can be used to check the quality of the injected beam. For this particular study, the sensors around the injection from the \acs{SPS} to the \acs{LHC} will be of particular interest. This data is stored using \acs{CERN}'s \ac{LS} [CITE HERE]. While many studies have been made using this logged data and lots of statistical tests have been done with regards to injection quality checks for the \acs{LHC} (such as [CITE HERE] and [CITE HERE]), no literature was uncovered where researchers used unsupervised machine learning methods to analyse this data.

%% On the Current IQC software
\paragraph{ }The \ac{IQC} software currently installed has a set of hard-coded rules for detecting anomalies in the \acs{SPS}-\acs{LHC} injection [CITE HERE], however there are documented cases in the past where situations occurred which were outside the originally foreseen rules and were therefore not caught as anomalies.
